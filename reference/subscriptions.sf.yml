        By default, customers receive abandoned cart emails as soon as they
        provide their email address in the checkout flow. They can opt out using
        this endpoint.

        However, if **Store Settings > Miscellaneous > Require Consent** is
        enabled, Abandoned Cart Emails are not sent by default, and the customer
        should opt-in.
